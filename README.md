Framework.php
=============

A simple PHP framework: this framework is designed to be quick to implement, but also provide the necessary security and organization of a PHP framework.

At its base, it's just an autoload script.
For optional use, there are classes for building websites based on the mvc-pattern.

More details will be added over the next few weeks, as this repository is very new right now.
